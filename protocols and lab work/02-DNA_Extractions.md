### 2023-08-31 

Two batches of extractions - one with 14 samples and the next with 24 samples for a total of 38 samples. No notes from these batches, protocol went as expected. 

Qubit BR Standard 1:  98.19
Qubit BR Standard 2:  13,270.00 (this seems low for standard 2 but the sample readings were in the correct range)

Gel electrophoresis results:

Several samples floated out of the well in the gel. I didn't see this during the testing, but is probably from residual ethanol leftover from a step within the Qiagen kit. I'm going back to the protocol to add an additional centrifuge step for the remaining ethanol. Ethanol can build up on the sides of the spin column. after the centrifuge step. I'm worried this ethanol in the DNA elute will inhibit the Pico methyl seq kit.

Qiagen [help page](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/faq?id=c40c90eb-48b7-4a32-ab6e-318605b93c16&lang=en) suggests incubating the DNA elute at 56C for 10 minutes. Qiagen support said that more than 10-15 minutes will start to degrade the DNA quality. 

> "Indeed warming up the sample should help. The more ethanol is in the eluate, the more time will be needed to evaporate it. Since prolonging such incubation too long would cause DNA degradation, if the 10~15 min incubation does not help, then evaporating all the liquid in Speedvac would be needed. many laboratories have those types of vacuum centrifudges, so it is worth to ask around. Usually it takes several hours for the DNA to start degrading. However, since the DNeasy protocol already contains a long incubation for sample lysis, it would be best not to extend this ethanol removal stel for more than one hour. 10-15 min is playing it safe." 

I tried this on a couple samples (that I would need to re-do anyway), and found that Qubit value generally did not decrease after heating - some increased, some decreased, some stayed the same: 

Qubit  
- BR DNA Standard 1: 196.31    
- BR DNA Standard 2: 23,312.56

> Response from Zymo: "A 10-minute incubation at 56°C shouldn't lead to any degradation for such an amount of time, and should therefore be perfectly fine to help evaporate the ethanol. It shouldn't lead to any detrimental effects of the methyl groups or significantly impact the downstream library prep, especially if the DNA is eluted in a stable buffer such as Tris, TE, or low EDTA TE." 

I'm going to move forward with extractions #1-39 doing 10 minute incubation to get rid of any residual ethnaol, then gel those samples and then decide if we keep them or not.

### 20230901 

One round of 24 samples.

### 20230905 

Round of 24 samples.

Incubated the samples from 0830 with residual ethanol:

### 20230906

Two rounds of 24 samples each. 

![](https://github.com/emmastrand/GMGI_Notebook/blob/main/lab%20work/2023%20Haddock%20DNA%20extractions/20230908%20gel%20extracts%200906.png?raw=true)

I noticed a black pellet in some of the DNA elutes when I was pulling them out of the freezer. Contacted Qiagen for technical support to see if this is just pigmentation. But once I vortexed the samples, used them for qubit and tapestation, the pellet resuspends and once frozen doesn't repellet again. I probably just didn't vortex them after the final elution step? The DNA quantity and quality is still good so I'll move forward with this for now b/c some extractions from pigmented tissue is known to have this happen. 

### 20230911 

Remaining samples.

The last two samples didn't work so I'm replacing Mae-460 with Mae-430. However, the other sample that didn't extract well does not have an alternate sample to replace it with so I will try one more time. 

## 20230915 

Last few samples. Mae-444 failed again (3rd time) so I'm replacing this sample with Mae-474 which is in the 10 yr age class because there were not any extras from Mae-444 age class.
