# Fin Clip Cleaning 

Haddock (*Melanogrammus aeglefinus*) fin clips from the NOAA Bottom Trawl Surveys: Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. The NOAA scientists sampled the pectoral fin and preserved in 100% molecular-grade ethanol (200 proof) and frozen on the boat. Each vial is wrapped in a labeling sticker with the date and organismal ID. This is a unique 4-6 digit code provided by NOAA. In our database at GMGI, we give each sample an ID based on our inventory status and the species. The GMGI species code is the first letter of Genus name and first two letters of the species name. E.g., the first sample from this project was the 261st Haddock sample so that fin clip's ID is Mae-261. Lab work fron this point on will use the numerical portion of the GMGI ID to indicate sample ID. This is simpler and is easier to label any tubes created with this ID. 

Example: 

| Species | Season    | Trawl_ID | GMGI_ID |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Haddock | Fall 2022 | 102603   | Mae-261 |
| Haddock | Fall 2022 | 105993   | Mae-262 |
| Haddock | Fall 2022 | 108311   | Mae-263 |
| Haddock | Fall 2022 | 108763   | Mae-264 |
| Haddock | Fall 2022 | 109505   | Mae-265 |

### Preparation 

2 mL tubes with the o-ring and screw cap for each sample (277) to long-term store these Haddock Fin Clips. Each tube will be labeled with the GMGI ID. Wear gloves while handling 2 mL tubes and labeling. GMGI_ID to be labeled on top and side of the 2 mL tube (see below)

Print sheet with fish metadata (Species, season, Trawl_ID, GMGI_ID, Notes) to use while clipping. Yellow highlighting will indicate a fin clip has been clipped to be smaller and new tube is filled. 

Fill each new 2 mL tube with 1.8 mL of 100% molecular grade ethanol. Do this in smaller batches so ethanol is not sitting in the tubes for an extended period of time. Not likely that I will do all 277 fin clips in one day.  

### Protocol for aliquoting

**Materials:**    
- 100% molecular grade ethanol for sample storage  
- 2 mL tubes with the o-ring and screw cap    
- gloves   
- sharpie, highlighter   
- tweezers   
- clippers   
- 50 mL falcon tubes   
- kimwipes   
- 70% ethanol for cleaning   
- 3 smaller coolers 
- ice  
- foil  
- falcon tube rack 

**Protocol steps:** 

The full protocol requires wearing sterilized gloves. 

1. Wipe down working area on lab bench with 70% ethanol then DI water.  
2. Fill a 50 mL falcon tube 80% full with 10% bleach.  
3. Fill two 50 mL falcon tubes 80% full with Type II DI water.  
4. Fill a 50 mL falcon tube 80% full with 70% ethanol.  

Be mindful about the above solutions getting dirty from use. Re-make as needed. 

5. Fill three small coolers 50% full with ice. To be used for handling samples to keep them cold. One will be the cooler for samples to be clipped and once completed, samples will be placed in another. The third cooler will be used for working space, with sterilized foil placed on top of the ice. 

Set-up will be similar to the image below. This is an example from clipping coral:

6. Sterilize a piece of foil (size will be determine by the size of the workign space cooler; see above for example) with 70% ethanol and then DI water. Place this piece of foil on top of the ice in the working cooler.  
7. Grab 15-25 sample vials from the freezer and place in a cooler with ice.    
8. Sterilize the tweezers and clippers in the following order: 10% bleach, Type II DI water, 70% ethanol, and Type II DI water. Place on top of the sterilized piece of foil.  

This clipping will take half of the original fin clip (we just don't need this much tissue) to store in a smaller tube for long term storage and our epigenetics aging project. If the fin clip is too long, clip in half according to the scheme below. Ideally, this sets up DNA extraction protocols easily so the clipping is ready to be taken out, clipped again for a smaller piece to be directly used in the extraction protocol. This project is based on using the pectoral fin.

9. Open a sample vial and with sterilized tweezers, place fin clip on the piece of foil.  
10. With a kim wipe, dab the fin clip dry and wipe the fin clip down to remove any mucus or potential contaminants from other fish. 

> Sampling takes place on a NOAA Bottom Trawl and fish are altogether on the boat. Changes of cross contamination are higher than a more controlled sampling environment. Pectoral fin is sampled with the side facing upwards to avoid contamination with any mucus on the table, but this step is just to be safe.    

11. With the clippers, cut a small portion of the fin clip (see the image above for example) and place in the 2 mL screw cap tube.   
12. Close the screw cap tube and double check both the side and top of the tube are labeled with the GMGI ID. 

> All tissue samples need to be fully submerged in 100% molecular grade ethanol. Add more to cover the fin clip if only a little is needed. Otherwise, the fin clip is too large and needs to be cut smaller. 

14. Place the leftover fin clip in the original NOAA Collection Vial and place back on ice. 

Repeat for as many fin clips as necessary and highlight the sample on hard copy sheets once done. Return all samples to the -80C freezer.
