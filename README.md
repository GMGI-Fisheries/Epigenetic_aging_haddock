A species-specific Haddock, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, epigenetic aging clock generated from 111 CpG loci. A) Otolith age (years) compared to epigenetic-predicted age (years). Aging model yielded R2=0.97 with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.12 years. B) MAE for all samples from 70% training (n=91 fish) and 30% testing (n=42 fish) sets. Median training MAE calculated as 0.09 years and testing MAE as 0.68 years. C) Scaled DNA methylation levels (z-score) for the 111 CpG loci (rows) for all 133 individuals (columns). Cluster 1 represents loci that increase methylation levels with age and Cluster 2 represents loci that decrease methylation levels with age.
